# Advanced Regression Project:
Project: House Price Prediction

## Project Overview:
In this project, we will be using machine learning to predict the price of a house based on various features of the house.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a robust machine learning model to predict house prices based on property features
- Implement and compare multiple regression algorithms to optimize prediction accuracy
- Deploy the model as a scalable web application with an intuitive interface
- Document the entire machine learning pipeline and model development process

## Dataset
**Source:** [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

### Dataset Description
The dataset comprises comprehensive residential property listings with the following key attributes:
- **Structural Features**: Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc.
- **Location Attributes**: Neighborhood quality, proximity to amenities, etc.
- **Temporal Features**: Year built, year remodeled, etc.
- **Sale Information**: Sale price, sale type, and sale condition
